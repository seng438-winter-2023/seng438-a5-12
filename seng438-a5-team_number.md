# Introduction

# 
This assignment was an opportunity for the group to familiarize ourselves with Software Reliability and Reliabilty assessment tools. Doing mutation testing exposed the group to using a mutation tool and also learning how to interpret the scores, tables and summary produced by the tool. Similarly using Selenium IDE for GUI testing enabled the group to understand and experiment with test automation. It also helped to think of and develop various test cases and suites that we could use to test the interface of the website.
