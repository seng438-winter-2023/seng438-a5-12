# Introduction

# 
This assignment was an opportunity for the group to familiarize ourselves with Software Testing and Reliability as well as Software Testing and Reliabilty assessment tools. The assignment allowed us to fully understand software testing and reliability by selecting a set of models that will provide the best fit for project data using model ranking. It also provided a visual representation that made it easy to check whether the target failure rate or MTTF was met.

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
A major difficulty we encountered as a group was getting the right dataset to run on our selected assessment tool (SRTAT).

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
This lab was a bit more frustating compared to the previous labs, as the instructions were quite vague and the applications needed to complete the assignment were not neccessarily responsive. However, the lab helped to bridge the gap between what had been taught in class and the actual uses of Software Testing and Reliability. It also gave the group a feel of actual tools and applications that are used to test software and reliability which would be useful as we advance in our Software Engineering careers.
